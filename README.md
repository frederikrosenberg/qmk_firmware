# Keyboard layout

This is the keyboard layout I use for my split keyboards. The structure is designed to support multiple keyboards while having a shared configuration.

## Setup

To start developing and compiling the firmware run the `setup.sh` script, be sure to change the user to your Github username. The script assumes that the qmk_firmware is located in the home directory.

Shout-out to metheon (https://github.com/metheon/qmk_layout) for the inspiration for the code layout.
